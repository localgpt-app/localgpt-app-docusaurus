# Introduction

LocalGPT is a **local device focused AI assistant with persistent memory and continuous operation capabilities** (or reshaped OpenClaw in Rust). It provides a command-line interface for interacting with various LLM providers while keeping all your data on your local machine.

## Key Features

- **Local Device Focused** - All data stays on your machine. No cloud storage, no telemetry.
- **Persistent Memory** - Markdown-based knowledge store with SQLite FTS5 full-text search
- **Multi-Provider Support** - Works with Claude CLI, OpenAI, Anthropic API, and local Ollama models
- **Skills System** - Extensible skills for specialized tasks (commits, PRs, code review)
- **Autonomous Heartbeat** - Schedule background tasks that run automatically
- **Session Management** - Automatic context compaction to handle long conversations
- **HTTP API** - RESTful API for integration with other tools

## Architecture Overview

```
~/.localgpt/
├── config.toml           # Configuration file
├── workspace/
│   ├── MEMORY.md         # Curated long-term knowledge
│   ├── HEARTBEAT.md      # Pending autonomous tasks
│   └── memory/
│       └── YYYY-MM-DD.md # Daily conversation logs
└── logs/
    └── agent.log         # Application logs
```

## How It Works

1. **Chat Sessions** - Start interactive conversations that maintain context
2. **Memory System** - Important information is saved to markdown files and indexed for search
3. **Tool Execution** - The AI can execute bash commands, read/write files, and search memory
4. **Heartbeat** - Background process checks `HEARTBEAT.md` for pending tasks

## Supported Models

LocalGPT automatically detects the provider based on model name prefix:

| Prefix | Provider | Examples |
|--------|----------|----------|
| `claude-cli/*` | Claude CLI | claude-cli/opus, claude-cli/sonnet |
| `gpt-*` | OpenAI | gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo |
| `o1-*` | OpenAI | o1-preview, o1-mini |
| `claude-*` | Anthropic API | claude-3-opus, claude-3-sonnet |
| Other | Ollama | llama3, mistral, codellama |
